# Rock, Paper, and scissors game

:fist_raised: :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: :v:

## Description

This is a python project of a rock paper and scissors game, aka Jo-ken-PO, this is based on a challenge suggested in the full stack developer course from Infinity school visual art center.         
The application is a simple game where the user chooses an option and receives a victory, defeat or tie message.      
Firstly I only used python for the code creation, however the further went, the more I realized I had to use other libraries like *Random* to make a random choice, and *tkinter* to create a simple UI.      
After the creation, I wish to add and better UI and finally create a website or .exe file to be viewed by other users.    
Finally, I'm really glad to share that I have finished this project in only one day. As a beginner for me, this is an incredible accomplishment.    

## How to use this project

(in construction) 

## Logic:

1. import libs.  
2. functions for each choice.  
3. Show a welcome message and instructions
4. ask for the user's input  
5. show the results:
    - If the user chooses an option that beats the computer's, print: ***"You won!"***  
    - if the user chooses the same option as the computer's, print:  ***"It's a tie!"***   
    - If the computer option beats the user's, print ***"You lost!"*** 

## Challenges:
1. My first challenge was the transition between a command line program to a User interface program, previously I had created only one function to check the user's choice and return the results, compared to the computer's. Then, I had to break into 3 different functions with unique processes.   
2. I had another challenge when I tried to put an image on a button, to serve as a visual guide to the user. I had to import PLI to manipulate the images.
